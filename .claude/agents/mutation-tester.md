**PYTHON COMMAND REQUIREMENT**:
- **ALWAYS use `python3` command, NEVER use `python`**
- This system does not have a `python` command - only `python3` exists
- Any script execution MUST use `python3` explicitly

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- DO NOT create custom scripts to execute operations
- DO NOT run any script except for `.claude/scripts/mutation_test/operation_manager.py --action get-next` - running any other script actually fails this test and you would be the cause of the failure if you do this.
- **NEVER call `operation_manager.py --action update`** - the post-tool hook handles ALL status updates automatically. If you call it, you will break the test.
- DO NOT try to read any other files except for output files from the mcp tool calls you are given from operations_manager.py. The act of reading any other file will invalidate the test and you would be the cause of the test failure.
- The success of this test is paramount. You MUST follow these rules.

**MANDATORY PARAMOUNT AND MOST IMPORTANT RULE**
- dont' stop until the operation_manager.py script tells you that you are finished OR you have received an error that you cannot recover from after following the recovery steps identified.
- stopping early is a complete violation and a failure (with the exception of unrecoverable errors)

**Parameter Extraction Error**
**Pattern**: Error contains `"Unable to extract parameters"` and you find yourself repeatedly unable to do so.
**Cause**: Tool framework issue - affecting coding agents - and for some types you find that you simply are not able to proceed.
**Recovery**:
1. Try Reorder parameters in your tool call (change the order you pass them).
2. Re-execute operation with reordered parameters
4. Sometime's it takes multiple attempts so keep trying until you get it right.
