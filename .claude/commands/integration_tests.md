# BRP Test Suite Runner

## Configuration
TEST_CONFIG_FILE = .claude/config/integration_tests.json  # Test configuration file location
PARALLEL_TESTS = read from `batch_size` field in ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}
AGENT_MODEL = opus  # Model for test runner agents

## Overview

This command runs BRP tests in three modes:
- **Without arguments**: Runs all tests ${PARALLEL_TESTS} at a time with continuous execution, stops immediately on any failure
- **With single test name**: Runs one test by name
- **With comma-delimited list**: Runs specified tests ${PARALLEL_TESTS} at a time, stops on any failure

## Usage Examples
```
/test                           # Run all tests ${PARALLEL_TESTS} at a time, stop on first failure
/test extras                    # Run only the extras test
/test extras,mouse        # Run extras and mouse tests
/test data_operations,events    # Run data_operations and events tests
```

## Test Configuration

**Configuration Source**: ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE} (see above)

This file contains a JSON object with:
- `batch_size`: Number of tests to run concurrently (used as PARALLEL_TESTS)
- `tests`: Array of test configurations

Each test entry has one of two formats:

**Single-app format** (most tests):
- `test_name`: Identifier for the test
- `test_file`: Test file path (relative to project root)
- `app_name`: App/example to launch (or "N/A" or "various")
- `app_type`: Type of app - "example" or "app" (null for "various" or "N/A")
- `individual_only` (optional): If true, this test is excluded from batch execution (All Tests Mode and Multiple Tests Mode). It can only be run via Single Test Mode (e.g., `/test mouse`). Use this for tests that require exclusive system access (e.g., mouse input tests that conflict with user mouse movement).

**Multi-app format** (tests needing multiple pre-launched instances):
- `test_name`: Identifier for the test
- `test_file`: Test file path (relative to project root)
- `apps`: Array of app instance objects, each with:
  - `app_name`: Name of the app/example to launch
  - `app_type`: Type of app - "example" or "app"
  - `label`: Unique label for referencing this instance in the test file
  - `fixed_port` (optional): If set, this instance uses this exact port instead of a dynamically allocated one
  - `consumed_by_test` (optional): If true, the test itself shuts down this app as part of its test steps. The runner must NOT shut it down during cleanup, but must verify it is no longer running (error if still alive).

**Note**: Test objectives are extracted from each test file's `## Objective` section, not stored in this config.

**Dynamic Port Allocation**:
- BASE_PORT = 20100
- Ports are dynamically allocated from pools based on app requirements
- Each app instance gets a sequential port starting from BASE_PORT

**IMPORTANT**: Count the number of test objects in test_config.json to determine the total number of tests. Do NOT assume it matches ${PARALLEL_TESTS}.

**CRITICAL COUNTING INSTRUCTION**: You MUST use the following commands to count tests accurately:
```bash
jq '.tests | length' ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}                                    # total tests
jq '[.tests[] | select(.individual_only == true)] | length' ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}  # individual-only tests
```
Note: Replace ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE} with the actual path from the configuration section above.
In batch modes (All Tests / Multiple Tests), report both counts: total tests in config and how many were excluded as `individual_only`. In Single Test Mode, just report the single test.

## App Management Strategy

Tests are categorized by app requirements:

### App-Managed Tests (Main Runner Handles)
Tests where `app_name` is a specific app (e.g., "extras_plugin", "test_app", "event_test"):
- Each test needs an app instance on a dynamically assigned port
- Main runner launches apps using instance_count for efficiency
- Main runner manages port pools and assignments

**Main runner handles:**
1. App launch on test-specific port
2. BRP connectivity verification (using brp_status)
3. App lifecycle management
4. Central cleanup

**Note**: Window titles are set by main runner after status verification

### Multi-App Tests (Main Runner Handles)
Tests with an `apps` array instead of `app_name`:
- Each entry in the array defines an app instance with a unique label
- Dynamic-port instances get sequential ports from the pool
- Fixed-port instances (`fixed_port` field) use their specified port
- Main runner launches all instances, verifies connectivity, and sets window titles
- Sub-agent receives a port map keyed by label and must NOT launch or shutdown apps

### Self-Managed Tests
- **various**: Tests handle their own app launching (path tests)
- **N/A**: No app required (list test)

## Reusable Operation Sections

<LaunchDedicatedApp>
1. **Launch**: Execute `mcp__brp__brp_launch` with target_name=[APP_NAME], port=[ASSIGNED_PORT], instance_count=[COUNT], search_order=[app_type from config, "app" or "example"], env=[ENV] (if env field exists on config entry)
2. **Track**: Record launched app for cleanup
</LaunchDedicatedApp>

<AllocatePortFromPool>
1. **Calculate Port**: Start from BASE_PORT (20100) + offset for app type
2. **Assign**: Take next available port from the appropriate pool
3. **Reserve**: Mark port as in-use for tracking
</AllocatePortFromPool>

<VerifyBrpConnectivity>
1. **Status Check with Retry**: For each app, retry up to 5 times with exponential backoff:
   - Attempt 1: Check `brp_status(app_name=[APP_NAME], port=[ASSIGNED_PORT])` immediately
   - If fails: Wait using `.claude/scripts/integration_tests/launch_retry.sh [attempt_number]`
   - Attempt 2-5: Retry with increasing delays (0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s)
   - This handles Cargo lock contention during concurrent launches
2. **Validation**: Confirm status is "running_with_brp"
3. **Error Handling**: If verification fails after all retries, stop and report
4. **Window Title**: Set title using `brp_extras_set_window_title` with format "{test_name} test - {app_name} - port {port}"
</VerifyBrpConnectivity>

<PrebuildWorkspace>
**Purpose**: Pre-compile all workspace targets to eliminate Cargo lock contention when multiple tests launch apps concurrently.

Run the following command and wait for it to complete:
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/integration_tests/prebuild_workspace.sh
```

- `--workspace` builds all library and binary targets, `--examples` additionally builds all examples
- Subsequent `cargo run` calls skip compilation and launch immediately
- **CRITICAL**: Must complete before ANY app launches
- Script uses strict error handling and preserves Cargo exit status
- If the build fails, STOP and report the build error

**WASM Prebuild** (conditional):
- Check if "wasm" is in the current test list (either running all tests or explicitly specified)
- If yes, additionally run:
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/integration_tests/prebuild_workspace.sh --include-wasm
```
- This MUST complete before the wasm test starts to avoid Cargo lock contention
- If the WASM build fails, STOP and report the build error
</PrebuildWorkspace>

<RetryNoOutputAgent>
If an agent returned "(Subagent completed but returned no output.)", resume it using its agent ID:
```
Agent(
  description="Retry [test_name] results",
  resume=agent_id,
  prompt="You completed all test steps but did not produce a results summary. Please provide your test results now using the required format."
)
```
- Use the resumed agent's output as the test result
- If the resumed agent ALSO returns no output, mark the test as "NO OUTPUT" (not failed, not passed)
- Maximum 1 retry per agent
</RetryNoOutputAgent>

<CleanupApps>
Apps fall into two categories based on the `consumed_by_test` field in the test config:

**Runner-managed apps** (no `consumed_by_test` or `consumed_by_test: false`):
1. Shut down using `mcp__brp__brp_shutdown(app_name=app_name, port=port)`
2. If shutdown fails, report as error

**Test-consumed apps** (`consumed_by_test: true`):
1. Do NOT attempt shutdown — the test was responsible for shutting these down
2. Verify they are no longer running using `mcp__brp__brp_status(app_name=app_name, port=port)`
3. If still running, report as **error** — the test failed to consume the app

**Clear port pools and tracking data** after all checks complete.
</CleanupApps>

<AllocatePortsForMultiAppTest>
For tests with an `apps` array, allocate ports for each app instance:
1. **Iterate** through the `apps` array entries
2. **Fixed-port apps**: If entry has `fixed_port`, assign that exact port to the label
3. **Dynamic-port apps**: Assign the next sequential port from the pool (starting at current_port)
4. **Return**: A map of `{label → port}` for all instances
5. **Note**: Fixed-port apps do NOT consume from the dynamic pool
</AllocatePortsForMultiAppTest>

<LaunchMultiAppInstances>
For tests with an `apps` array, launch all app instances:
1. **Group** apps by `(app_name, app_type, env)`, separating fixed-port from dynamic-port entries. Apps with different `env` configs get separate groups.
2. **Dynamic-port batch launch**: For each group of dynamic-port apps with the same `(app_name, app_type, env)`. Include env parameter when present:
   - Execute <LaunchDedicatedApp/> with instance_count=count, starting at the first allocated port
   - This launches multiple instances in a single call for efficiency
3. **Fixed-port individual launch**: For each fixed-port app:
   - Execute <LaunchDedicatedApp/> with instance_count=1, port=fixed_port
4. **Track**: Record all launched apps (label, app_name, port) for cleanup
</LaunchMultiAppInstances>

<VerifyMultiAppConnectivity>
For tests with an `apps` array, verify all instances and set window titles:
1. **For each app** in the `apps` array:
   - Execute <VerifyBrpConnectivity/> on the assigned port (from the label→port map)
   - **Skip BRP verification** for apps that don't have BRP (e.g., no_extras_plugin) — instead just verify the process launched using `brp_status` to confirm a PID exists
2. **Set Window Titles**: For each app with BRP, set title using format: `"{test_name} test - {label} - {app_name} - port {port}"`
</VerifyMultiAppConnectivity>

## Execution Mode Selection

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine mode:**

1. **Split on commas**: Parse `$ARGUMENTS` by splitting on commas
   - Use: `echo "$ARGUMENTS" | tr ',' '\n'` to get test names (one per line)
   - Trim whitespace from each name

2. **Select mode based on count**:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not provided: Execute **All Tests Mode**
   - If split produces 1 test name: Execute **Single Test Mode**
   - If split produces 2+ test names: Execute **Multiple Tests Mode**

## Single Test Mode (1 test name in $ARGUMENTS)

### Execution Instructions

1. **Load Configuration**: Read test configuration from ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}
2. **Find Test**: Search for test configuration where `test_name` matches the test name
3. **Validate**: If test not found, report error and list available test names
4. **Execute Test**: If found, run the single test using appropriate strategy

### Single Test Execution

0. Execute <PrebuildWorkspace/>

**For tests with an `apps` array (multi-app tests):**
1. **Clean up stale processes** from previous test runs:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/scripts/integration_tests/cleanup_stale_test_processes.sh ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}
   ```
2. Execute <AllocatePortsForMultiAppTest/> to build the label→port map
3. Execute <LaunchMultiAppInstances/> for all app entries
4. Execute <VerifyMultiAppConnectivity/> for all instances
5. **Execute Test**: Use MultiAppPrompt template with the label→port map, model=${AGENT_MODEL}
6. If agent returned no output, execute <RetryNoOutputAgent/>
7. Execute <CleanupApps/> for all app instances launched for this test

**For tests where app_name is a specific app (not "various" or "N/A"):**
1. **Clean up stale processes** from previous test runs:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/scripts/integration_tests/cleanup_stale_test_processes.sh ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}
   ```
2. Execute <AllocatePortFromPool/> for single port
3. Execute <LaunchDedicatedApp/> with instance_count=1
4. Execute <VerifyBrpConnectivity/> for assigned port
5. **Execute Test**: Use DedicatedAppPrompt template with assigned port, model=${AGENT_MODEL}
6. If agent returned no output, execute <RetryNoOutputAgent/>
7. Execute <CleanupApps/> for single app

**For self-managed tests (app_name is "various" or "N/A"):**
1. **Execute Test**: Use SelfManagedPrompt template directly, model=${AGENT_MODEL}
2. If agent returned no output, execute <RetryNoOutputAgent/>

### Error Handling

If no test configuration matches the test name:
```
# Error: Test Not Found

The test "{test_name}" was not found in ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}.

Usage: /test [test_name[,test_name...]]
Examples:
  /test extras
  /test extras,mouse
```

## Multiple Tests Mode (2+ test names in $ARGUMENTS)

### Execution Instructions

1. **Load Configuration**: Read test configuration from ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}
2. **Parse Test Names**: Split `$ARGUMENTS` on commas and trim whitespace from each name
3. **Validate All Tests**: For each test name, search for matching test configuration
   - If ANY test not found, report error listing all missing tests and available test names
   - If all found, continue to execution
4. **Filter Test List**: Build test list containing only the specified tests (preserve config order). If any specified test has `individual_only: true`, warn the user that it was skipped (e.g., "Skipping 'mouse' — individual_only test, run separately with `/test mouse`") and exclude it from the batch. If ALL specified tests are `individual_only`, report that no tests remain and exit.
5. **Execute Tests**: Use the same batched parallel execution as "All Tests Mode" (see below), but with filtered test list

### Error Handling

If any test configuration is not found:
```
# Error: Tests Not Found

The following tests were not found in ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}:
- {test_name1}
- {test_name2}

Available tests: {list of all available test names}

Usage: /test [test_name[,test_name...]]
Examples:
  /test extras
  /test extras,mouse,data_operations
```

## All Tests Mode (when no $ARGUMENTS)

### Setup Phase

**Before running tests:**

0. **Record Start Time**: Run `date +%s` and store as `SUITE_START_EPOCH` for wall clock timing

1. Execute <PrebuildWorkspace/>

2. **Clean up stale processes** from previous test runs:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/scripts/integration_tests/cleanup_stale_test_processes.sh ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}
   ```

3. **Load Configuration**: Read ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}

4. **Extract Test List**: Execute this EXACT command:
   ```bash
   jq -c '.tests[] | select(.individual_only != true) | {test_name, test_file, app_name, app_type, apps}' ${TEST_CONFIG_FILE}
   ```
   This produces one JSON object per line, in config order. Tests with `individual_only: true` are excluded from batch execution. Tests with `apps` array will have `app_name: null` and `app_type: null`.

5. **Extract Objectives and Build Test List**:
   - Collect all test_file paths from step 3 into a space-separated list
   - Extract all objectives in one call: `.claude/scripts/integration_tests/extract_test_objectives.sh file1.md file2.md ...`
   - This returns one objective per line, matching the order of input files
   - Combine with test data from step 3 (line-by-line pairing)
   - Store in test list: {test_name, test_file, app_name, app_type, test_objective}

### Batched Execution with Just-In-Time App Launching

**CRITICAL PARALLEL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST execute tests in parallel by creating a SINGLE message with multiple Task tool invocations.
DO NOT execute tests sequentially (one Task, wait for result, then next Task).

**For each batch of up to PARALLEL_TESTS tests:**

1. **Select Next Batch**: Take next PARALLEL_TESTS tests from the test list. Track the current batch number (starting from 1).

2. **Analyze Batch App Requirements**:
   - For single-app tests: Identify unique app_name values in this batch (excluding "N/A" and "various"), count instances needed per app_name
   - For multi-app tests: Add each entry from the `apps` array to the requirements list
   - Example: If batch has 3 single-app tests using "extras_plugin" and 1 multi-app test with 2 extras_plugin + 1 no_extras_plugin, need extras_plugin×5 and no_extras_plugin×1

3. **Allocate Ports for Batch**:
   - Start at BASE_PORT=20100
   - For single-app tests:
     - For each unique app: assign sequential ports starting from current_port
     - Track: app_name → [port1, port2, ...]
     - Increment current_port by instance count
   - For multi-app tests: Execute <AllocatePortsForMultiAppTest/>
     - Fixed-port apps get their `fixed_port` value (do NOT consume from dynamic pool)
     - Dynamic-port apps get sequential ports from the pool
   - For self-managed tests (app_name is "N/A" or "various"): assign port=null

4. **Launch Apps for This Batch Only**:
   - For single-app tests: Group by app_name, execute <LaunchDedicatedApp/> with instance_count=count
   - For multi-app tests: Execute <LaunchMultiAppInstances/>
   - Track all launched apps for cleanup

5. **Verify App Connectivity**:
   - For single-app tests: Execute <VerifyBrpConnectivity/> on each launched port in PARALLEL
   - For multi-app tests: Execute <VerifyMultiAppConnectivity/>
   - If any verification fails, cleanup and STOP

6. **Set Window Titles**:
   - For single-app tests with assigned port, execute in PARALLEL:
     ```
     mcp__brp__brp_extras_set_window_title(
       title="{test_name} test - {app_name} - port {port}",
       port={port}
     )
     ```
   - Multi-app window titles are set in <VerifyMultiAppConnectivity/>

7. **Create Task Prompts for Batch**:
   - For each test in batch:
     - If test has `apps` array → use MultiAppPrompt with label→port map, [TEST_NAME], [TEST_FILE], [TEST_OBJECTIVE]
     - If test has specific `app_name` (not "various"/"N/A") → use DedicatedAppPrompt with [TEST_NAME], [ASSIGNED_PORT], [APP_NAME], [TEST_FILE], [TEST_OBJECTIVE]
     - If test has `app_name` of "various" or "N/A" → use SelfManagedPrompt with [TEST_NAME], [APP_NAME], [TEST_FILE], [TEST_OBJECTIVE]

8. **Execute Batch Tests in Parallel**:
   - Create SINGLE message with multiple Task invocations (one per test in batch)
   - Example:
     ```
     <single_message>
     Task(description="Execute test1", prompt=DedicatedAppPrompt_for_test1, model=AGENT_MODEL)
     Task(description="Execute test2", prompt=DedicatedAppPrompt_for_test2, model=AGENT_MODEL)
     ... up to PARALLEL_TESTS tasks
     </single_message>
     ```
   - Wait for ALL tasks in batch to complete

9. **Retry No-Output Agents**:
   - For each agent result, check if it returned "(Subagent completed but returned no output.)"
   - For each no-output agent, resume it using its agent ID:
     ```
     Agent(
       description="Retry [test_name] results",
       resume=agent_id,
       prompt="You completed all test steps but did not produce a results summary. Please provide your test results now using the required format."
     )
     ```
   - Use the resumed agent's output as the test result
   - If the resumed agent ALSO returns no output, mark the test as "NO OUTPUT" (not failed, not passed)
   - Maximum 1 retry per agent

10. **Check Batch Results**:
   - Monitor for failure indicators in any test result
   - If ANY test failed: Execute <CleanupApps/> for batch apps and STOP
   - If all passed: Continue to step 11

11. **Cleanup Batch Apps**:
    - Execute <CleanupApps/> for all apps launched in this batch
    - Clear batch tracking data

12. **Continue or Complete**:
    - If more tests remain: Return to step 1 for next batch
    - If all tests complete: Proceed to step 13

13. **Compute Wall Clock Time and Rebalance**:
    - Run `date +%s` and store as `SUITE_END_EPOCH`
    - Compute `TOTAL_WALL_CLOCK_SECONDS = SUITE_END_EPOCH - SUITE_START_EPOCH`
    - Convert to minutes and seconds for display (e.g., "4m 23s")
    - Collect `duration_ms` from each test agent's task notification (convert to seconds: `duration_ms / 1000`)
    - Record which batch number each test ran in
    - Build key=value pairs: `test_name=seconds` for every test
    - Run the rebalance script:
      ```bash
      python3 .claude/scripts/integration_tests/rebalance_tests.py test1=X.X test2=Y.Y ...
      ```
    - Include the rebalance output in the final summary under "## Rebalance"
    - If the script fails, note the error but do not treat it as a test failure

### Error Detection and Immediate Stopping

**CRITICAL**: After each batch completes, check ALL test results for failure indicators:
- Check for `### ❌ FAILED` sections with content
- Check for `**Critical Issues**: Yes` in summary
- Check for any `CRITICAL FAILURE` mentions in results

**On Error Detection**:
1. **Cleanup batch apps** - shutdown all apps from current batch
2. **STOP immediately** - do not start any new batches
3. **Report failure** with details from failed test and batch summary

### Results Formats

**Success Path**: After all tests complete successfully:
```
