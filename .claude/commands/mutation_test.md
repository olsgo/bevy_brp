# Type Guide Comprehensive Validation Test

**Command Type**: Execute-only. Runs automatically from STEP 0-3, then offers optional interactive failure review if failures detected.

<ExecutionFlow>
**STEP 0:** read .claude/config/mutation_test_config.json
**STEP 1:** Execute <BatchProcessingLoop/> (DO NOT output results yet)
**STEP 2:** Execute <FinalCleanup/> (ALWAYS - shutdown apps)
**STEP 3:** Execute <TestResultOutput/> followed by <FinalDiagnosticOutput/> (ALWAYS - show summary and diagnostic table)
**STEP 4:** Execute <AskUserToReviewFailures/> (ONLY if review failures detected - ask user before proceeding)
**STEP 5:** Execute <InteractiveFailureReview/> (ONLY if user confirms they want to review)
</ExecutionFlow>

## STEP 1: BATCH PROCESSING LOOP

<BatchProcessingLoop>
For each batch (auto-discovered from all_types.json):
1. Output progress: "Starting batch processing..."
2. Execute <ReportProgress/>
3. Execute <GetBatchAssignments/>
4. Execute <PrepareApplications/>
5. Execute <DisplayBatchConfiguration/>
6. Execute <LaunchMutationTestSubagents/>
7. Execute <ProcessBatchResults/>
8. Execute <CheckForFailures/>

Continue until all batches processed or failures occur.
</BatchProcessingLoop>

<GetBatchAssignments>
Execute script and check for errors:
```bash
python3 ./.claude/scripts/mutation_test/prepare.py
```

**CRITICAL**: Check exit code and handle errors:

**If exit code is 0** (success):
- Parse JSON output from stdout
- Fields include:
  - `batch_number` - current batch number (auto-discovered)
  - `total_types` - unique types being tested in this batch
  - `max_subagents` - number of subagents being used
  - `types_per_subagent` - configured types per subagent
  - `progress_message` - pre-formatted progress message for display
  - `assignments` - array of subagent assignments with fields:
    - `window_description` - window title
    - `task_description` - task description
    - `test_plan_file` - test plan path
    - `port` - port number
- Store the complete JSON response for use in <ReportProgress/>, <PrepareApplications/>, <LaunchMutationTestSubagents/>, and <FinalCleanup/>
- Continue to <ReportProgress/>

**If exit code is non-zero** (error):
- Display error messages from stderr to user
- Present error summary:
  ```
  ❌ MUTATION TEST PREPARATION FAILED

  prepare.py encountered an error during batch preparation.

  Error details:
  [stderr output from prepare.py]

  Common causes:
  - Deduplication validation failure (duplicate representatives or missing representatives)
  - Invalid all_types.json structure
  - Configuration file errors

  The mutation test cannot proceed. Please fix the error and try again.
  ```
- EXIT immediately (do not proceed to any other steps)
</GetBatchAssignments>

<ReportProgress>
Display the `progress_message` field from <GetBatchAssignments/> JSON output.

Example: "Processing batch 1 of 16 - Testing 8 types split across 10 subagents (152 remaining)"
</ReportProgress>

<PrepareApplications>
Task a 'mutation-prepper' subagent to prepare applications using the assignments JSON:

```
description: "Prepare apps for batch N"
subagent_type: "mutation-prepper"
prompt: |
  Execute the workflow defined in @.claude/instructions/mutation_test_prep.md

  You are preparing application instances for mutation test batch N.

  Use the following assignments JSON to set window titles in STEP 4:

  ```json
  [PASTE COMPLETE JSON FROM GetBatchAssignments]
  ```

  Follow all steps in the instruction file. Report any errors immediately.
```

Wait for subagent to complete before proceeding to <DisplayBatchConfiguration/>.
</PrepareApplications>

<DisplayBatchConfiguration>
Read and display the batch configuration from the mutation test log:

```bash
Read tool: /tmp/mutation_test.log
```

Present the complete contents to the user with the file name prefix:

```
/tmp/mutation_test.log

[Full log file contents - at this point contains only the header with batch configuration table]
```

This shows the user which types are being tested in this batch and how they're distributed across subagents.

Proceed to <LaunchMutationTestSubagents/>.
</DisplayBatchConfiguration>

<LaunchMutationTestSubagents>
For each assignment in assignments array, create Task:

```
description: assignment.task_description
subagent_type: "mutation-tester"
prompt: |
  EXECUTE the mutation test workflow defined in @.claude/instructions/mutation_test_subagent.md

  Your configuration:
  - PORT = [assignment.port]

  Use the operation_manager.py script to get operations and execute them in sequence.

  CRITICAL: After completing all operations, just finish. Do not return any JSON output.
```

Send ALL Tasks in ONE message for parallel execution.
</LaunchSubagents>

<ProcessBatchResults>
1. Execute script and capture JSON output:
```bash
python3 ./.claude/scripts/mutation_test/process_results.py
```

2. Parse JSON response (output is on stdout):
- `status` - "SUCCESS", "RETRY_ONLY", "FAILURES_DETECTED", or "ERROR"
- `batch` - {number, total_batches}
- `stats` - {types_tested, passed, failed, missing_components, remaining_types}
- `retry_failures` - array of retry failure summaries
- `review_failures` - array of review failure summaries
- `warnings` - array of warning messages
- `retry_log_file` - path to detailed retry failure log (null if none)
- `review_log_file` - path to detailed review failure log (null if none)
- `diagnostic_info` - array of diagnostic entries for all tested types

3. Store the complete JSON output for use in <CheckForFailures/>, <TestResultOutput/>, <FinalDiagnosticOutput/>, and <InteractiveFailureReview/>

**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT output results yet - results will be displayed in STEP 3 after cleanup.
</ProcessBatchResults>

<CheckForFailures>
Based on `status` field from ProcessBatchResults JSON:

**"SUCCESS"**:
- If STOP_AFTER_EACH_BATCH is true: EXIT batch loop
- If STOP_AFTER_EACH_BATCH is false: Continue to next batch

**"RETRY_ONLY"**:
- If STOP_AFTER_EACH_BATCH is true: EXIT batch loop (retries will be picked up on next run)
- If STOP_AFTER_EACH_BATCH is false: Continue to next batch (renumbering will retry these types)

**"FAILURES_DETECTED"**:
- EXIT batch loop (will show results and review failures in later steps)

**"ERROR"**:
- EXIT batch loop with error flag

**Note**: FinalCleanup, TestResultOutput, and Diagnostic Output happen in STEP 2-3 after batch loop exits.
</CheckForFailures>

## STEP 2: FINAL CLEANUP

<FinalCleanup>
For each port in the assignments array (stored from <GetBatchAssignments/>), execute in parallel:

```
mcp__brp__brp_shutdown(app_name="extras_plugin", port=PORT)
```

Where PORT is each assignment's port value from the assignments JSON.

Mode: SILENT (no output to user)
</FinalCleanup>


## STEP 3: RESULT OUTPUT AND DIAGNOSTICS

**ALWAYS execute both sections below, regardless of STOP_AFTER_EACH_BATCH setting or test status.**

### Test Result Summary

<TestResultOutput>
Using the stored JSON output from <ProcessBatchResults/>, present results using the template defined in the <TestResultOutput/> section below.
</TestResultOutput>

### Diagnostic Information

<FinalDiagnosticOutput>
Using the `diagnostic_info` array from the ProcessBatchResults JSON output:

```
---

## DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION

**Debug log**: /tmp/mutation_test.log

**Tested Types**:

| Port | Type | Status | Failed Op |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
{FOR each entry in diagnostic_info:}
| {entry.port} | `{entry.type_name}` | {entry.status} | {entry.failed_operation_id if not None else ""} |
{END FOR}

---
```

**Purpose**: Provides quick access to all test artifacts for debugging:
- Port numbers for filtering debug logs and identifying test instances
- Test plan files showing operation status
- Failed operation IDs for pinpointing issues
- Hook debug log for comprehensive execution trace

Output completion: "✅ Mutation test batch complete."
</FinalDiagnosticOutput>


## STEP 4: ASK USER TO REVIEW FAILURES

<AskUserToReviewFailures>
**Only execute if `review_failures` array is not empty in ProcessBatchResults JSON.**

After displaying TestResultOutput and FinalDiagnosticOutput, ask the user:

```
## Next Steps

Review failures were detected. Would you like to:
- **review** - Start interactive failure review
- **stop** - Stop here (you can review failures later using the log files)

Please choose an option.
```

Wait for user response:
- If user chooses "review": Proceed to STEP 5 <InteractiveFailureReview/>
- If user chooses "stop": End command execution
- If unclear: Ask for clarification
</AskUserToReviewFailures>


## STEP 5: INTERACTIVE FAILURE REVIEW

<InteractiveFailureReview>
**Input**: Use `review_log_file` path from ProcessBatchResults JSON output

1. Read detailed failure data from review log file:
```bash
Read tool on {review_log_file}
```
This gives full failure details including operations_completed, failure_details, query_details.

2. Create todos using TodoWrite:
   - "Display failure summary and initialize review process"
   - "Review failure [X] of [TOTAL]" (one per review failure)

3. Display summary:
```
## MUTATION TEST EXECUTION COMPLETE

- **Status**: STOPPED DUE TO FAILURES
- **Progress**: Batch [N] of [TOTAL] processed
- **Results**: [PASS_COUNT] PASSED, [FAIL_COUNT] FAILED, [MISSING_COUNT] MISSING COMPONENTS
- **Review failures log**: [review_log_file path]
- **Retry failures log**: [retry_log_file path] (if any)
```

4. For each failure, present:
```
## FAILURE [X] of [TOTAL]: `[type_name]`

### Overview
- **Entity ID**: [entity_id]
- **Total Mutations**: [total] attempted
- **Mutations Passed**: [count] succeeded
- **Failed At**: [operation type or mutation path]

### What Succeeded Before Failure
[List successful operations]

### The Failure

**Failed [Operation/Path]**: [specific failure point]

**What We Sent**:
```json
[request]
```

**Error Response**:
```json
[response]
```

### Analysis
[Error analysis]

---

## Available Actions
- **investigate** - Investigate this failure (DEFAULT - always investigate first)
- **skip** - Skip to next failure
- **stop** - Stop review

Please select one of the keywords above.
```

5. Execute <CheckCommonPatterns/> immediately after presenting each failure
   - Runs quick diagnosis for each pattern using /tmp/mutation_test.log
   - If pattern signature matches: Execute pattern section
   - If no patterns match: Execute <InvestigateFailure/>
6. Wait for user response
7. Handle keyword: investigate (already done), skip (next failure), stop (exit)

**Note**: Only review failures (real BRP errors) are reviewed. Retry failures (subagent crashes) are automatically retried in the next batch.
</InteractiveFailureReview>

<CheckCommonPatterns>
**Pattern Detection Dispatcher**

For each pattern, run quick diagnosis. If diagnosis matches, execute pattern section.

**Pattern 1: Missing Component**

Quick diagnosis - Check /tmp/mutation_test.log for this type:
```bash
grep "{failed_type_name}" /tmp/mutation_test.log | grep -E "spawn_entity.*SUCCESS|query.*FAIL"
```

Signature:
- One port shows: `spawn_entity` → `SUCCESS`
- Different, subsequent port shows for the same type: `query` → `FAIL` (Query returned 0 entities)

**If signature matches**: Execute <MissingComponent/>

---

**Pattern 2: BRP Connection Lost**

Quick diagnosis - Check /tmp/mutation_test.log:
```bash
grep "port={port}" /tmp/mutation_test.log | tail -20
```

Signature:
- Multiple `SUCCESS` operations
- Sudden "HTTP request failed" or "Connection failed"

**If signature matches**: Execute <BRPConnectionLost/>

---

**No patterns matched**: Execute <InvestigateFailure/>
</CheckCommonPatterns>

<MissingComponent>
**Pattern: Missing Component in Test App**

Run diagnostic:
```bash
grep -c "{failed_type_name}" test-app/examples/extras_plugin.rs
```

**If count = 0** (component not spawned at startup):

Parse /tmp/mutation_test.log to extract:
- Port where spawn succeeded
- Port where query failed
- Operation IDs

Present findings:
```
✅ PATTERN: Missing Component in Test App

Type `{type_name}` is not spawned in extras_plugin.rs at app startup.

Log Evidence:
- Port {spawn_port}: op_id={spawn_op_id} spawn_entity → SUCCESS ✅
- Port {query_port}: op_id={query_op_id} query → FAIL (0 entities) ❌

Root Cause:
Multi-part tests on different ports run separate app instances. Part 2 expected
to find entities from startup, but extras_plugin.rs doesn't spawn this type.

**Fix**: Add `{type_name}` entity to test-app/examples/extras_plugin.rs
Search for similar components to find appropriate spawn function.
```

**If count > 0** (component exists):
Present: "Component exists in extras_plugin.rs - different issue."
Execute <InvestigateFailure/> for full analysis.
</MissingComponent>

<BRPConnectionLost>
**Pattern: BRP Connection Lost**

1. Parse /tmp/mutation_test.log for port {port}:
   - Last successful operation timestamp
   - Failed operation details
   - Time gap

2. Read /tmp/mutation_test_{port}.json to find last successful operation:
   - Extract operation details (component, path, value)
   - This mutation likely caused the app to crash

Present findings:
```
✅ PATTERN: BRP Connection Lost

BRP server connection failed after {N} successful operations.

Log Evidence:
- Port {port}: op_id={last_success_id} → SUCCESS at {timestamp1}
- Port {port}: op_id={fail_id} → FAIL at {timestamp2}
- Gap: {seconds}s

Likely Culprit - Last Successful Mutation:
- Component: `{component}`
- Path: `{path}`
- Value: {value}
- Type: `{type_name}`

Root Cause:
The mutation succeeded from BRP's perspective, but caused the app to crash
or become unresponsive shortly after, breaking the connection for subsequent operations.

**Investigation Focus**:
This specific mutation is likely incompatible with the component's implementation:
1. The value may violate invariants not checked by BRP
2. The component may have unsafe code that panics on this value
3. The mutation may trigger a cascade failure in dependent systems

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Test this exact mutation in isolation to reproduce the crash
2. Check {component} implementation for panics or unsafe code
3. Add validation or mark this mutation path as invalid if appropriate
```
</BRPConnectionLost>

<InvestigateFailure>
1. Run: `.claude/scripts/mutation_test/get_type_guide.sh <failed_type_name> --file .claude/transient/all_types.json`
2. Examine type guide for failed mutation path
3. Check `path_info` for `applicable_variants`, `root_example`, `mutability`
4. Present findings and recommendations
5. Do NOT launch Task agents
</InvestigateFailure>
