Launches Bevy apps

Features: Non-blocking execution, temp directory logs, debug/release profiles, multi-instance support, optional Cargo features.

Multi-instance launching:
- When instance_count > 1, launches multiple instances on sequential ports starting from the specified port.
- Each instance gets its own log file with port in filename

Notes:
- If multiple apps with the same name exist in different paths, you must specify the path parameter.
- Path matching supports: full relative paths (e.g., "bevy_brp/my-app"), partial paths (e.g., "my-app"), or workspace names for disambiguation.
- When specifying a port, bevy_brp_extras is required to support listening on the environment variable `BRP_EXTRAS_PORT`.
- Use the `features` parameter to enable Cargo features when building (e.g., `["game"]` or `["game", "audio"]`).
