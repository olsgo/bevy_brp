Capture screenshots from running Bevy applications using bevy_brp_extras.

Parameters:
- path (required): File path to save the screenshot
- delay_frames (optional): Frames to wait before capture (default: 2)
  Use this to avoid white/blank screenshots by ensuring the scene has rendered.
  Set to 0 for immediate capture (may result in blank screenshots on early frames).

Behavior:
- Waits specified frames to ensure scene is fully rendered
- Captures frame via bevy_brp_extras/screenshot
- Converts to RGB8 (strips alpha for correct HDR handling)
- Saves to specified path asynchronously

Prerequisites:
- bevy_brp_extras dependency required
- BrpExtrasPlugin must be registered
